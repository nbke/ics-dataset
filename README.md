# Multi-Stage Attacks on the Siemens S7 Protocol Using an Industrial Control System Testbed
Overview
This repository hosts a dataset created as part of our research on the cybersecurity of Industrial Control Systems (ICS), specifically focusing on Multi-Stage Attacks on the Siemens S7 Protocol. The dataset is derived from a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testbed simulating a microgrid environment with multiple renewable energy power plants. The dataset is intended for use in developing and testing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and other cybersecurity measures for critical infrastructure.

# ICS Dataset

**export.csv:** This file contains time-series data collected from the ICS network during normal operations and various attack scenarios. It includes labeled entries identifying specific types of cyberattacks, allowing for easy differentiation between benign and malicious activities.

**Fields:** \
**Timestamp:** The exact time at which each event or packet was captured.\
**Source IP:** IP address of the source device.\
**Destination IP:** IP address of the destination device.\
**Protocol:** The communication protocol used (e.g., S7Comm, Modbus/TCP).\
**Payload:** Encoded data exchanged between devices.\
**Label:** A categorical label indicating the type of activity (e.g., "Normal", "Data Modification Attack", "Multi-Stage Attack").\

**simul_data.csv:** Simulation data representing the operational states of the microgridâ€™s components (photovoltaic plant, wind plant, battery storage) under different scenarios. This file includes both normal operation and manipulated states caused by cyberattacks.

**Fields:**\
**Time:** Simulation time in seconds.\
**Power Output:** Actual power generated by each plant.\
**Target Power:** Power level set by the control system.\
**Voltage:** Voltage levels at various nodes in the microgrid.\
**Current:** Current flowing through the system.\
**State of Charge (SOC):** SOC for the battery storage system.\

The dataset provides comprehensive coverage of multiple cyberattack scenarios, including:

**Normal Operation:**

Captures the baseline behavior of the microgrid without any interference. Useful for understanding standard operations and for training IDS to recognize normal patterns.

**Data Modification Attacks:**

Scenarios where attackers intercept and modify control commands. This includes the alteration of power output commands or falsification of monitoring data to mislead the control center.

**Multi-Stage Attacks:**

Complex attacks involving multiple steps, such as establishing a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) position, injecting false commands, and simultaneously manipulating monitoring data to avoid detection. These scenarios highlight vulnerabilities in the Siemens S7 protocol and demonstrate the potential impact on grid stability.

# Data Collection Methodology
Data was collected using a HIL testbed comprising the following components:\

**Siemens PLC 1516-3:** Used to control the photovoltaic power plant.\
**Siemens PLC 1512C-1:** Manages the battery storage system.\
**Siemens PCS 7 410E:** Central control system managing communications between all power plants.\
**MATLAB Simulink:** Simulates the physical processes of power generation and storage.\
**Siemens WinCC:** SCADA software used for monitoring and controlling the microgrid.\
Network packets were captured using a mirror port on a SCALANCE switch, with **libpcap** in promiscuous mode to capture all relevant data. The dataset was further enriched by syslog messages captured from the PLCs, providing additional context on the system's operational state during the attacks.

# Usage
**Recommended Applications**
**Intrusion Detection Systems:** The dataset is ideal for developing and testing IDS models that can detect both simple and complex attack patterns in ICS environments.\
**Cybersecurity Research:** Researchers can use the data to explore the vulnerabilities of ICS networks, especially those using Siemens S7 protocols.\
**Anomaly Detection:** The dataset can be employed to train algorithms for identifying anomalies in control commands and sensor data.\
